- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io, WebRTC
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Encryption**: AES-256, RSA-2048, WebCrypto API
- **Media Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Cloud Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions

## 📋 Implementation Details

### End-to-End Encryption

- Uses asymmetric (RSA) encryption for key exchange
- Implements symmetric (AES) encryption for message content
- Keys are stored locally and never transmitted to the server
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) with periodic key rotation

### WebRTC Implementation

- Peer-to-peer voice and video calls
- Fallback to TURN servers when direct connection isn't possible
- Adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
- Support for group calls with mesh network architecture

### Scalable Database Design

- Sharded Firestore collections for horizontal scaling
- Efficient data model for real-time updates
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Data partitioning for multi-region deployment

### Message Delivery System

- Real-time delivery status tracking
- Offline message queueing
- Reliable message ordering with logical timestamps
- Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Latex999/secure-chat-app.git
cd secure-chat-app
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Update the variables with your Firebase configuration.

4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🌟 Usage

1. Create an account with email/password or social auth
2. Add contacts via username or QR code
3. Start conversations with individuals or create groups
4. Initiate voice/video calls with the call button
5. Share media and documents securely
6. Manage notification settings per conversation

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All message content is end-to-end encrypted
- Voice and video calls are encrypted and peer-to-peer when possible
- Authentication uses modern security practices
- No message content is stored on servers in decrypted form
- Regular security audits and updates

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Desktop application (Electron)
- [ ] Additional authentication methods
- [ ] Message reactions and threads
- [ ] Advanced search functionality
- [ ] Custom themes and app personalization
- [ ] End-to-end encrypted cloud backup
